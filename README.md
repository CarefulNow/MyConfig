# MyConfig
My system config broken out into ansible roles to make it easy to
bring up a new system from the ground up. This config is for
MACs and only MACs at the moment. If I ever get a system-76 or
similar this will have to change.

## Alacritty
Terminal configuration such as colours etc.

## ASDF
Installing java versions and python versions easily plus
other random SDKs

## Colima
Container runtime for both Docker and K8s (with nerdctl)

## Displaylink
For the USB-C Thunderbolt hub....

## Git
Well some handy git configuration??? Mostly aliases plus some
other nice to haves

## GPG
For my yubikey setup

## Hammerspoon
Window management with the Shiftit keybindings

## Homebrew
If you use mac and don't use homebrew....what do you use???

## Karabiner
Swapping around some keys as they always seem to appear in the
wrong place on the keyboard.

## NeoVim
My IDE.... yep an IDE which is still being tailored and worked
on actively.

## OSX Defaults
Because for some reason MACs key-repeat is depressingly slow.
Needs some work to find the need for holding down a letter to
show the accents.

## Shared Config
Setting up the `.config` directory etc.

## SSH
For setting up some sane defaults on SSH config. In other words
use a yubikey for everything.

## TMUX
Some nice tmux defaults.... I do need to find something nicer
than tmux for terminal multiplexing but it still does the job.
I have found myself using it less and less over the past weeks
however....

## ZSH
My shell of choice for now at least. Oh-my-zsh included. Needs
some work on the colours to match the b-e-a-utiful dark tokyonight
theme in use everywhere else.
